title: "Week 7: NLP for Occupation Coding"

## 1. Welcome to Week 7 👋

**Focus:** Using NLP in Python to code free-text job responses  
**Goal:** Map survey responses like _"software dev"_ to standardized occupation codes (e.g. **ISCO-08**)

In this session:
- What NLP is & why it matters for surveys
- A text-to-code pipeline
- Tools & skills you’ll apply

---

## 2. Why Use NLP for Coding Jobs?

📄 Survey data often includes open-text job descriptions:
- "cashier at supermarket"
- "hospital nurse"
- "manages IT systems"

🧠 Manual coding is time-consuming and inconsistent

✅ NLP lets us **automate and standardize** classification  
→ e.g., map to **ISCO codes** for analysis or reporting

---

## 3. NLP Workflow for Job Coding

1. **Text Cleaning**  
2. **Tokenization & Lemmatization**  
3. **Matching / Classification**  
4. **Output: ISCO code**

This week, we focus on **steps 1–3** — the backbone of an NLP coding pipeline.

---

## 4. Step 1: Text Cleaning 🧼

Make text more consistent:
- Lowercasing  
- Removing punctuation  
- Standardizing common terms (“dev” → “developer”)

```python
text = "Software Dev / IT systems"
cleaned = text.lower().replace("/", " ")
```

🧠 Pre-cleaning improves accuracy in later steps.

---

## 5. Step 2: Tokenization & Lemmatization 🧩

Break the text into **words (tokens)** and reduce them to root form:

```python
import spacy
nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")
doc = nlp("software developers managing systems")

tokens = [token.lemma_ for token in doc if not token.is_stop]
```

→ `['software', 'developer', 'manage', 'system']`

---

## 6. Step 3: Rule-Based or ML Matching

Approaches:
- **Rule-based**: keyword dictionaries (e.g. “nurse” → 2221)
- **Fuzzy matching**: handle typos & variants
- **ML classifiers**: predict ISCO from text

```python
if "nurse" in tokens:
    code = "2221"  # ISCO-08: Nursing professionals
```

---

## 7. Challenges in Real-World Data

⚠️ Survey responses are often:
- Vague: "I work in IT"
- Misspelled: "enginer"
- Ambiguous: "consultant" (which kind?)

→ NLP helps structure & interpret **messy human input**

---

## 8. Tools You’ll Use

🧰 This week, you’ll use:
- `spaCy` – for cleaning, tokenizing, lemmatizing
- `fuzzywuzzy` or `rapidfuzz` – for flexible matching
- Your own lookup tables or mapping dictionaries (e.g., ISCO keywords)

Advanced (not this week): sklearn for text classification

---

## 9. Real-World Impact 💼

Structured occupation codes:
- Enable **labour force analysis**
- Feed into **policymaking, earnings models, diversity studies**
- Standardize across countries using **ISCO-08**

Your work today mirrors real tasks in government, academia & industry.

---

## 10. This Week’s Outcomes

✅ By the end of Week 7, you will:
- Preprocess free-text responses
- Extract keywords from job descriptions
- Prototype a simple job → ISCO code system

➡️ Let’s begin with the text cleaning step!
