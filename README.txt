[GitHub](https://github.com) is a developer platform that allows developers to create, store, manage and share their code. This is also the platform we will be using to share the course
materials and host the discussion. This can be a great place to see what other
data scientists are up to and what cool projects are being worked on.

In order to set up an account  
Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and Click **Sign Up** (top right).
