Hi there, I'm Ose


# Software List for the Course

In order to engage fully with the course and achieve all of the goals of the
training course, it is necessary that you set-up the following software tools.

These are all free to use and should be relatively easy to set up.
If you have any issues in the set-up, please do not hesitate to ask a question
using the GitHub issues, or reach out to one of the Data Science Campus team.

## GitHub Account

[GitHub](https://github.com) is a developer platform that allows developers to create, store, manage and share their code. This is also the platform we will be using to share the course
materials and host the discussion. This can be a great place to see what other
data scientists are up to and what cool projects are being worked on.

In order to set up an account 
Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and Click Sign Up (top right).

Enter:
Your email address, a username, a secure password and Click Create Account.

You’ll be asked to verify your email—check your inbox and follow the instructions.
Choose Free Plan when prompted.

Once your account is set up, you can customize your profile, add a profile picture, etc.

Once you are set up on GitHub, you will need to ask for access to NBS GitHub organisation
