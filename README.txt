In order to use Python to write code and check that this works as expected, we
need a computer application to interact with.

At the same time, it would be convenient if this application would let us use Git
to connect to the repository and make sure that our work is kept updated.

There are a variety of tools that we could use for this. In this course, we will
be using Visual Studio Code (also known as VS Code). This is an application that
is free to use, is the industry standard and provides a flexible space, with loads
of features to do our coding in.

In order to get started, download the application from [the official website](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

Run the installer and follow the prompts.

After Installation: Open VS Code.

Go to the Extensions tab (left sidebar or press Ctrl+Shift+X).

Install the following extensions: Python by Microsoft, Jupyter (for notebooks), GitHub Pull Requests and Issues, GitLens

Open the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P or Cmd+Shift+P) and run:

Shell Command: Install 'code' command in PATH
(This allows you to open folders in VS Code from your terminal.)

Open a folder:
File > Open Folder and choose a working directory for your projects.

The set-up steps might be a bit more complicated, so we will cover this during
the sessions, so don't worry too much about getting it perfect.
