# VS Code Extensions

Once you can access VS Code and you have downloaded
both Git and Python to your computer, the fun can begin!

This document will provide guidance on some of the most useful extensions that
we recommend to work with Python and Git. Initially this will also cover some
useful tips on how to find extensions and know which are worthwhile.

## Finding VS Code Extensions

Once inside VS Code, on the left hand icon list, you should be able to see
an icon with three squares, this is the extensions tab. Once you click on it, the left hand pane should have a search bar for extensions and some recommended extensions. Later on, here you can also see extensions that you have installed.

When searching extensions, you should be able to see their details by clicking on them, much like you would see on any other app store. Two things to have in mind when choosing extensions are:

- The number of downloads: This information can be found next to a cloud with an arrow point down.
- A verified developer: If the extension has been built by someone that VS Code thinks is trustworthy, there would be a blue tick showing it.

In order to install an extension, click on it and then on its page, there should be a button to `Install`.
