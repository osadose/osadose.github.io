# Welcome to the Python Git Course

**Master Git and Python in One Practical Curriculum**

This course is designed to help you build a strong foundation in both **Python programming** and **Git version control**. Over the span of 8 weeks, you’ll write code, manage files, track changes with Git, and collaborate using GitHub — all with hands-on practice and real-world examples.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## What You’ll Learn

-   **Python fundamentals** — variables, data structures, loops, and functions\
-   **Data analysis** — loading, cleaning, and analyzing datasets using Python\
-   **Git version control** — repositories, commits, branches, merges, and remotes\
-   **GitHub collaboration** — cloning, pull requests, and managing contributions\
-   **Project organization** — best practices for clean, reproducible code
