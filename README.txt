Q1. What skills or knowledge do you have that would make you a good fit for this role? (~301 words)
As a data scientist, I bring a mix of analytical skills, organisation, and collaboration that I believe makes me well suited to the Content Support Officer role.
In my current role, I manage projects that involve multiple stakeholders and shifting priorities. This has helped me develop strong planning skills and the ability to deliver under pressure. I am used to balancing technical accuracy with clarity, which would be essential when reviewing speaking notes, checking for consistency, and ensuring content is accessible to a broad audience.
Attention to detail is central to my work. Whether I am analysing large datasets or drafting reports for senior colleagues, I take care to check accuracy and avoid errors. This same mindset would be valuable in ensuring event programmes run smoothly, with no clashes or last-minute issues.
I also have experience supporting stakeholders, including senior leaders and technical experts. I often explain complex ideas in simple, clear terms, building confidence in those I work with. I see this as directly relevant to supporting speakers at Civil Service Live, where reassurance and good preparation can make a real difference.
On the technical side, I am confident with digital platforms and quick to learn new systems. I would have no difficulty uploading and managing content or keeping programme documents updated.
Above all, I value opportunities to contribute beyond my immediate role. Civil Service Live is an event that inspires thousands of colleagues across government, and I would be proud to apply my skills to support its success.
Q2. How would you make Civil Service Live more inspiring and empowering for civil servants? (~303 words)
Civil Service Live has the potential to inspire colleagues by sharing ideas, celebrating achievements, and providing practical tools they can take back to their roles. I would contribute to making the event impactful by focusing on relevance, accessibility, and confidence.
Firstly, I would support Theme Leads in securing a diverse range of speakers. By balancing strategic voices from senior leaders with practical insights from colleagues at the frontline, the programme would feel more inclusive and relatable to staff at all levels.
Secondly, I would ensure clarity and accessibility in the content. As a data scientist, I am experienced in turning complex findings into straightforward, engaging outputs. I would apply this by reviewing speaking notes and presentations to make sure they are clear, concise, and inclusive. I would also support making materials available digitally so staff who cannot attend in person still benefit.
Thirdly, I would help speakers feel confident and well prepared. From experience, I know that even the most knowledgeable people benefit from reassurance and clear guidance. By ensuring they have what they need, I could help them deliver sessions that energise and inspire audiences.
Finally, I believe the best events leave colleagues with something practical to use. Whether thatâ€™s a fresh perspective, a new skill, or a tool to share with their teams, I would encourage sessions that are action-oriented rather than purely informative. This ensures the event not only inspires but also empowers people to apply what they have learned.
By combining analytical skills, clear communication, and teamwork, I would help Civil Service Live provide colleagues with both inspiration and practical value.
Q3. How much time do you think you will be able to allocate to this programme overall? (~100 words)
I am able to commit to the minimum of 10 days between November 2025 and July 2026. I have considered this with my line manager and am confident I can balance the commitment alongside my day-to-day responsibilities. If needed, and subject to agreement, I would be willing to contribute additional time to support key milestones. I see this as an opportunity to apply my skills in a different context and will prioritise making a meaningful contribution to the programme.
Q4. Are there any periods you will be unable to work on this project? (~90 words)
At this stage, I am not aware of any periods that would prevent me from contributing to the project. I do expect to take some annual leave in 2026, but I will plan this well in advance and share dates with both my line manager and the project team to avoid disruption. If any unforeseen peaks in workload arise, I will manage my time effectively and communicate clearly to ensure continuity of support. I am committed to being a reliable and flexible member of the team.
